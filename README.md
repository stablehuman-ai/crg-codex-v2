\## Agent Working Principle



\- Always use the provided documentation. When they cannot inform your decision. Lean on best practices. Reasonable defaults and making things easier for the user.



\## Project Documentation Map



\- SPEC.md – Canonical system rules and data formats (source of truth)

\- ARCHITECTURE.md – High-level system design and reasoning

\- TASKS.md – Implementation checklist and milestones

\- AGENT.md – Instructions and constraints for coding agents

\- CHEATSHEET.md – Quick reference for humans

\- PROMPT.md – Human-only prompt material (not authoritative)



If there is a conflict:

SPEC.md > ARCHITECTURE.md > TASKS.md > AGENT.md > CHEATSHEET.md
